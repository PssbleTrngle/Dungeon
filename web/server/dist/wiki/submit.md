# How do I submit a structure?

![Room outlined by a structure block]('structure_block.png')

You first have to place down a `Structure Block: /give @p minecraft:structure_block`.
Select the size depending on the type of structure you are building and make sure it is placed within the bounds.

![Parts outlined by a metadata block]('metadata_block.png')

If you want to provide metadata information, such as the weight or substructure parts,
place a `Metadata Block: /give @p dungeon:metadata_block` next to the structure block.
It will visualize where the defined parts will generate and can be used to load and save the information to a metadata file.

This mod adds a variety of *placeholder blocks*, which will be replaced by the corresponding blocks
from a random [Palette](/wiki/palettes 'Block Palettes') at generation. It is adviced but not neccassary to use these.
Think about wether or not you need a block to be the exakt one you are using or just a variant of its type
