# Block Palettes

![Small setup to show placeholder blocks]('placeholder_blocks.png')

There are several placeholder blocks added by this mod, used to build the structures.
At generation they will be replaced by *real* blocks choosen from a random **Palette**

![The same room with different palettes]('palettes.png')

These palettes define one or multiple blocks for each placeholder type, and come in various themes and are distributed similar to biomes.

Palettes are, like [Structures]('/wiki/structures'), saved in the *data* folder.
They are saved as XML files and can be validated against the provided schema.
The default palette files can be found at [Github]('https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/Dungeon/tree/palette-serializing/src/main/resources/data/dungeon/palettes),
as well as the schema file.
