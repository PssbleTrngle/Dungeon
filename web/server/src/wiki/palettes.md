# Block Palettes

![Small setup to show placeholder blocks]('placeholder_blocks.png')

There are several placeholder blocks added by this mod, used to build the structures.
At generation they will be replaced by *real* blocks choosen from a random **Palette**

---

These palettes define one or multiple blocks for each placeholder type, and come in various themes.
