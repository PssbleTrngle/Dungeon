Their are several types of prebuilt structures the dungeon is made up of.
The most important ones are the room and hallways, both one chunk big.

Structure are saved in the *data* folder and can be included in datapacks like recipes.
If you want to know how to build and use your own structure, take a look at the [Wiki Page]('/wiki/submit').
You can also submit these structures to me on the [Submit Page]('/submit') and they might be added to default mod structures.
